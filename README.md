# Vid2Gif
 Video to Gif converter. I am hoping to evolve this into a useful tool for anyone. So, Vid2Gif is under active development.

# But WHY
I needed a gif maker and I couldn't find one online that I can install on my system, perhaps I didn't look enough and just wanted to create my own :)
Since I have a quick video capture tool on my system I wanted to create something fits what I need. There you go!

# HOW?
Place the video you want in the same folder named as <b>vid.mp4</b> and it will convert it to <b>vid.gif</b>


# Roadmap
<ul>
 <li><b>GUI</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>A functional UI. Bare minimum</li>
  <li>Has browse button</li>

 </ul>
